** Introduction

I had a need to build a mountable laser with optional cylindrical lens
to either emit a line or a point.  I don't have access to a 3d-printer
yet but periodic access to a laser cutter.  So, this is a first attempt
at building what I need and possibly what others might need.

My source of lasers is none other than the Dollar Store's pet laser.

** First Pass:
Design, build, and use it.

*** Notes:
- not enough tolerance on the lens holder
- need to draw in drill-holes for mounting on any side
- additional support for the laser to avoid strain on glue
- draw laser symbol
- draw laser direction
